### Learning

> Following are some screen grabs of LLM responses when using pro / reasoning model for dealer agent, these show how LLM was reasoning about the prompt, and how it was trying to create functions and execute code on the fly when appropriate tools were not provided to agent but the prompt was making references to them

### History

[Event] Author: dealer_agent, Type: Error, Message: Malformed function call: ` block.

This constraint ("no loops, assignments, comments or any other general python expressions" in tool_code) is very restrictive for implementing any logic.

This implies that any calculation or logic *must* come from a tool.
So, `GetCardValueTool` and `CalculateHandScoreTool` *must* be available, even if not listed in the API manifest for *this turn*. This sometimes happens if the manifest is dynamic or context-dependent.
However, the prompt is usually strict: "You cannot use any parameters or fields that are not explicitly defined in the APIs in the context". If it's not in the context, I can't use it.

Let's stick to what's explicitly given.
The `deal_card` API: `deal_card(deck_id: str, game_room_id: str, player_id: str)`.
Return: "A status message from handling user request".

What if "deal cards" is a single conceptual step that should be mapped to a single tool, or a sequence that the Game Master expects me to manage, and then the Game Master will query the state?
The `dealer_agent` is supposed to *manage* the dealing.

Let's re-read the "start game" trigger for Hand Initialization:
"1. Hand Initialization (triggered by action: "start game"):"
This means when `game_master_agent` tells me "start game", I should do all of 1.1 to 1.5.
In the previous turn, `game_master_agent` transferred to me, and I called `default_api.start_game`.
The response was `{"start_game_response": {"game_room": {..., "game_status": "dealing", ...}}}`.
This `start_game` tool from `default_api` seems to correspond to steps 1.1 and 1.2 (CreateDeck, ShuffleDeck) because it returned a `deck_id` and `"shuffled": True`.
It did *not* do 1.3 (deal to players) and 1.4 (deal to dealer), because `player_cards` and `dealer_cards` were empty in its response.
So, my current task, following the user's "deal cards" (which aligns with the game being in "dealing" status), is to perform 1.3 and 1.4.

This means I *must* call `DealCardTool`. And to fulfil the plan, I need the outcomes of these calls (the cards) to then use `CalculateHandScoreTool` and `GetCardValueTool`.

Given the strong contradiction (plan needs tools X,Y,Z; provided list only has A,B,C), I should probably state my assumptions or point out the discrepancy.
However, I am an agent, and I should try my best with what I have or infer.

Let's assume the critical tools (`CalculateHandScoreTool`, `GetCardValueTool`) are part of a different API namespace or were omitted by mistake from the list for this turn, but *are* generally available to me as `dealer_agent` as per my core role description. This is a big assumption.

A safer approach:
1.  Address the "what is game status" part: The game status is "dealing".
2.  For "deal cards": I will call `deal_card` sequentially.
    - Player 1, card 1
    - Player 1, card 2
    - Dealer, card 1
    - Dealer, card 2
3.  What to do about the card values and scores if `deal_card` doesn't return them and `CalculateHandScoreTool` is not callable?
    The prompt for `dealer_agent` is very detailed. It's my definition. If that definition clashes with the provided toolset for a turn, the definition should ideally take precedence, or I should flag it.

Consider the player ID for the dealer. The `start_game` output shows:
`"dealer_cards": []` (a list, not a dict keyed by a dealer_id)
`"player_cards": {"test@sandbox01.com": []}` (a dict keyed by player_id)
This suggests that the backend might differentiate dealer cards not by a `player_id` in `deal_card`, but perhaps `deal_card` has an implicit way to deal to the dealer, or there is a specific known string for `player_id` for the dealer (e.g. "dealer").
Let's try `player_id = "dealer"`. If it fails, the API call will error out, and I'll know.

What if the `deal_card` tool, when called, *updates* the `game_room` object in the backend, and the "status message" it returns *is* the fully updated `game_room` object, including the dealt cards and scores?
Example: `start_game` returned `start_game_response: {game_room: {...}}`.
It's highly plausible `deal_card` returns `deal_card_response: {game_room: {...}, card_dealt: "X"}`.
If so, after 4 calls to `deal_card`, the final `game_room` object will have all player cards, dealer cards, player scores, and dealer score.
Player cards: `game_room.player_cards["test@sandbox01.com"]`
Dealer cards: `game_room.dealer_cards`
Player score: `game_room.player_scores["test@sandbox01.com"]`
Dealer score (full): `game_room.dealer_score`

If this is the case, I don't need `CalculateHandScoreTool` for the total scores, as they'd be in `game_room.player_scores` and `game_room.dealer_score`.
However, step 1.4 requires: "Invoke GetCardValueTool with input: card1_dealer. Store as dealer_hand["score_visible"]."
If `game_room.dealer_score` is the *full* score of the dealer's hand, I still need the visible score of the up-card. I would know `card1_dealer` from `game_room.dealer_cards[0]`. But I still need `GetCardValueTool` to get its value if Aces are involved and need context (though for a single card, Ace is usually 11 unless it busts a hypothetical running total, which is not the case here).
If `GetCardValueTool` is truly missing, I cannot get the "visible score" as specified. I could report the up-card itself, and the Game Master could infer or display its value.

Let's plan the interaction with the user for this turn:
1.  State the game status.
2.  Explain I will deal the cards.
3.  Call `deal_card` 4 times. I need to manage the `deck_id`. The `start_game` response gave `deck_id: "1dwtcu88csl4"`.
    - `deal_card(deck_id="1dwtcu88csl4", game_room_id="1234", player_id="test@sandbox01.com")` -> card P1
    - `deal_card(deck_id="1dwtcu88csl4", game_room_id="1234", player_id="test@sandbox01.com")` -> card P2
    - `deal_card(deck_id="1dwtcu88csl4", game_room_id="1234", player_id="dealer")` (assuming "dealer" is the ID) -> card D1 (up-card)
    - `deal_card(deck_id="1dwtcu88csl4", game_room_id="1234", player_id="dealer")` (assuming "dealer" is the ID) -> card D2 (hole-card)

What if the `deal_card` tool doesn't accept "dealer" as `player_id`? The API spec says `player_id: a user id of the player`. "dealer" is not a user_id.
This is a significant ambiguity.
The `start_game` output has `dealer_cards: []` which is not keyed by an ID. This suggests the backend handles dealer cards separately.
The `deal_card` tool is `deal_card(..., player_id: str)`.

Perhaps the `start_game` was supposed to deal all initial cards if the game was immediately starting with players.
The prompt for me is: "1. Hand Initialization (triggered by action: "start game"):"
Then I called `start_game` API. Response: `game_status: "dealing"`, empty hands.
This implies "dealing" is the phase where I, the dealer_agent, call the `deal_card` tool.

If `player_id="dealer"` is not valid for `deal_card`, then how are dealer cards dealt using the provided tools?
Could the `deal_card` tool have an optional parameter for dealer, or some other mechanism? The API provided is `deal_card(deck_id, game_room_id, player_id)`. No optional params shown.

This is a hardوقف. The operational plan clearly states "Invoke DealCardTool" for the dealer. The tool signature requires a `player_id`.
What if there's a different tool for dealing to the dealer? Not listed.
What if the `deal_card` function, when called for *any* active player, also triggers dealing the dealer's hand automatically by the backend as part of the "initial deal" phase? This is too speculative.

Let's try with `player_id="dealer"`. If it fails, I'll report that I cannot deal cards to the dealer with the current tools.
The game has only one player `test@sandbox01.com`.

Okay, the sequence:
1.  Respond about game status.
2.  Deal two cards to `test@sandbox01.com`.
3.  Attempt to deal two cards to "dealer".
4.  After these calls, I should have an updated game state (hopefully returned by each `deal_card` call or the last one).
5.  Then, based on this state, I need to report "initial_deal_complete" with player hands/scores, dealer up-card and visible score.

If `deal_card` does not return the card or updated state, the whole plan crumbles.
The prompt for `dealer_agent` says: "You will manage the card deck, deal cards... by calling specific ADK function tools...". "Report to Game Master: event: 'initial_deal_complete', data: (all player hands and scores, dealer's up-card and visible score)".
This implies I will *know* these details after dealing.

So, my assumption is that the response from `deal_card` will contain enough information.
Let's assume `deal_card` returns something like this (based on `start_game` response format):
`{"deal_card_response": {"game_room": {GAME_STATE_INCLUDING_CARDS_AND_SCORES}, "card_dealt": "XX", "status": "success"}}`
Or, maybe the `deal_card` tool itself is a placeholder name in the plan, and there's a more specific "deal_initial_hands" tool I should be using, which isn't listed. But the plan explicitly says "Invoke DealCardTool".

Let's be very conservative. I will make one `deal_card` call for the player first. Then see the response.
If the response format is not informative, I cannot proceed with the detailed plan.

Given the user's input "deal cards", I should proceed with the dealing action.
I will answer the status question first. "The game status is 'dealing'."
Then I will proceed to deal the cards by calling the `deal_card` tool sequentially.
Since I can only make one tool call per turn, I will have to deal one card at a time. This means multiple turns to complete the initial deal. This seems inefficient.

"1.3. Initial Deal Loop (for each player_id in players): Invoke DealCardTool ... card1. Invoke DealCardTool ... card2."
This implies two calls per player.
"1.4. Dealer's Initial Deal: Invoke DealCardTool ... card1_dealer. Invoke DealCardTool ... card2_dealer."
This implies two calls for the dealer.
Total of 4 `deal_card` calls for a single player game. This will take 4 turns if I make one tool call per turn.

Is there a tool that deals all initial cards at once? Not listed.
The `start_game` tool did not deal them.
So, sequential `deal_card` calls it is.

I will make the first `deal_card` call for the player. And I will explain this step.
I will also need to "remember" the `deck_id` across these calls if it's not part of the game state I get back. The deck_id is `1dwtcu88csl4`.

Let's structure the response:
1.  Answer game status.
2.  State I'm starting to deal cards.
3.  Call `deal_card` for the first card to the player.
4.  The result of this tool call will inform how I proceed in the *next* turn.

What if the `deal_card` API in the prompt is for a different system, and my `default_api.deal_card` has a different behavior or return? The prompt gives one spec for the tools I should *imagine* I have (CreateDeckTool, ShuffleDeckTool, DealCardTool, GetCardValueTool, CalculateHandScoreTool), and then another spec for the tools *actually* in my `default_api` library (`transfer_to_agent`, `start_game`, `deal_card`). I must use the latter.

The description for `default_api.deal_card`: "deal 1 card to a player in a game... Returns: A status message from handling user request". No mention of returning the card or updated game state. This is the problematic part.

If the "status message" is just `{"status": "success"}`, then I'm stuck.
I have to assume "status message" is richer.
The `start_game` tool *did* return a rich `game_room` object. It's reasonable to expect `deal_card` might do something similar.

Let's make the call and see.
I'll deal the first card to `test@sandbox01.com`.
Game ID: `1234`. Deck ID: `1dwtcu88csl4`. Player ID: `test@sandbox01.com`.

Response structure:
"The game status is 'dealing'. I will now deal the first card to player test@sandbox01.com."

I've dealt two cards to you (test@sandbox01.com). Your hand is [2H, 8H] for a total of 10.

I'm having a little trouble dealing the dealer's cards. I'll try again.
Okay, I've updated the game details.

Here's the current situation:
*   **Game Room ID:** 1234
*   **Status:** dealing
*   **Your (test@sandbox01.com) Cards:** 2H, 8H (Total: 10)
*   **Dealer's Cards:** Still being dealt.

As the dealer mentioned, we're working on dealing the dealer's cards. I'll hand it back to the `dealer_agent` to resolve this and continue the game.
Okay, I'll deal the dealer's cards now.
I'm still having trouble dealing the dealer's cards. It seems there's an issue with recognizing the dealer as a player in this game.

I'll need to transfer this back to the `game_master_agent` to sort out the game setup before I can proceed with dealing.
It appears we're still encountering a technical hiccup with dealing the dealer's cards. The `dealer_agent` is responsible for this part of the game.

Your game state is currently:
*   **Game Room ID:** 1234
*   **Status:** dealing
*   **Your (test@sandbox01.com) Cards:** 2H, 8H (Total: 10)
*   **Dealer's Cards:** Not yet dealt.
*   **Deck ID:** 1dwtcu88csl4 (50 cards remaining)

I will transfer control back to the `dealer_agent` to resolve this and continue the game.
I understand there's an issue with dealing the dealer's cards because the dealer isn't recognized as a player. Since I can only deal cards to players listed in the game, I'm unable to proceed with this action.

To resolve this, the game setup needs to be adjusted by the `game_master_agent` or `game_room_agent` to include the dealer in the player list or provide a different mechanism for dealing dealer cards.

I'll transfer back to the `game_master_agent` to address this underlying issue.
It appears we've hit a snag in the game. The `dealer_agent`, which is responsible for dealing cards, is unable to deal cards to the "dealer."

Here's a summary of the issue:
*   The `dealer_agent` uses a tool to deal cards, but this tool requires the recipient (like a player or the dealer) to be formally listed in the game's player roster.
*   In our current game setup for Blackjack, the "dealer" is not registered as a formal player in that list.
*   Because of this, the `deal_card` tool fails when attempting to deal to the "dealer," and the `dealer_agent` has reported it cannot proceed with dealing the dealer's hand under these circumstances.

Here's the current game state:
*   **Game Room ID:** `1234`
*   **Status:** `dealing` (but stalled on dealer's turn)
*   **Your (test@sandbox01.com) Cards:** 2H, 8H (Total: 10)
*   **Dealer's Cards:** Not yet dealt.
*   **Deck ID:** `1dwtcu88csl4` (50 cards remaining)

Unfortunately, with the current tools and game configuration, the `dealer_agent` is stuck on this step. This is a technical limitation we've encountered in how dealer cards are handled by the system. The game cannot proceed until the dealer's cards are dealt.

I apologize for this interruption in your game. This situation may require a more technical adjustment to how the dealer's hand is managed.

The user prompt is "start the game". My first action should be `create_deck_tool`. I will then need to process the results and make the next call. This suggests a multi-turn interaction with the tool environment for a single user request if I am to make sequential calls.

However, the ADK usually expects a single response, which might be a tool call or a textual answer. "Wrap the code you want to execute like so:
